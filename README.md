# Portfolio
 Initially for HTML/CSS front-end development projects, may expand or branch in the future

 There may be a lack of commits for a period of time as I created this repo at the beginning of my journey so that I will have a place to post code right when it is ready.

 The projects here will be fully personally coded and projects built by following tutorials etc. If a project posted here was created by googling or otherwise finding a general idea for the project it will be stated clearly. Likewise projects that were thought up by myself will be stated clearly.
